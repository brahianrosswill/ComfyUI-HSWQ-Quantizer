# ComfyUI-HSWQ-Quantizer
### Unofficial ComfyUI reference implementation of Hybrid Sensitivity Weighted Quantization (HSWQ)

## Overview
This repository provides an **unofficial reference implementation** of **Hybrid Sensitivity Weighted Quantization (HSWQ)** for ComfyUI.

The original HSWQ method and core algorithm were proposed and released by:
👉 [https://github.com/ussoewwin/Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization](https://github.com/ussoewwin/Hybrid-Sensitivity-Weighted-Quantization)

> **Note:** This project does not modify the original algorithm. Its purpose is to make HSWQ practically usable inside ComfyUI workflows.

It provides:
* **A calibration node:** Collects HSWQ statistics during normal image generation.
* **A conversion node:** Applies V1-compatible FP8 quantization using the collected statistics.

This implementation is intended as a practical integration / reference, not as an alternative or competing implementation.

---

## What This Implementation Adds
Compared to the original scripts, this repository focuses on **workflow-level integration**:

### ComfyUI Custom Nodes
* **Calibration (statistics collection):** Hooks into the generation process.
* **FP8 conversion:** Converts models directly within ComfyUI.

### Session-Aware Calibration
* **Accumulation:** Statistics can be accumulated across multiple runs.
* **Safe Saving:** Uses atomic saving to avoid corrupted stats files.

### Dual Monitor Statistics
* **Output sensitivity:** Tracks activation variance.
* **Input channel importance:** Tracks per-channel contribution.

### V1-Compatible FP8 Conversion
* **Smart Layer Selection:** Keeps top-k sensitive layers in **FP16**.
* **Optimization:** Applies weighted histogram MSE optimization for FP8 `amax` selection.
* **2D Input Handling:** Correctly handles `(B, C)` inputs.
  * *Crucial for adaLN / embedding-like layers and NextDiT-style blocks.*

All algorithmic decisions follow the design described in the original repository.

## Scope and Non-Goals

### ✅ In Scope
* Practical ComfyUI integration
* Reference implementation for real workflows
* Faithful reproduction of HSWQ V1 behavior

### ❌ Out of Scope
* Proposing new quantization algorithms
* Changing HSWQ theory or selection criteria
* Replacing the original implementation

## Installation
Clone this repository into your ComfyUI `custom_nodes` directory:

```
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<yourname>/ComfyUI-HSWQ-Quantizer
```

> Please restart ComfyUI after installation.

## Provided Nodes

### 1. HSWQ Calibration (Dual Monitor)
Collects calibration statistics while running standard SDXL generation.

**Key features:**
* Hooks into UNet forward passes
* **Tracks:**
  * Output sensitivity (variance)
  * Input channel importance
* Session-based accumulation
* Automatic checkpointing

**Typical usage:**
1. Insert the calibration node into your SDXL workflow.
2. Run generation multiple times.
3. Statistics are saved automatically as `.pt` files.

### 2. HSWQ FP8 Converter
Converts an SDXL UNet model to FP8 using collected calibration statistics.

**Conversion process:**
1. Load calibration statistics.
2. Rank layers by sensitivity.
3. Keep top `keep_ratio` layers in **FP16**.
4. Quantize remaining layers to **FP8** (`torch.float8_e4m3fn`).
5. Optimize `amax` using weighted histogram MSE (HSWQ V1).

The output model remains compatible with standard ComfyUI loaders.

## Recommended Settings
These settings follow the guidance from the original HSWQ repository:

| Parameter | Typical value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Calibration samples** | `~256` | Number of images/steps to analyze |
| **keep_ratio** | `~0.25` | Ratio of layers to keep in FP16 |
| **Optimization steps** | `20–25` | Steps for MSE optimization |

*Exact values may vary depending on the model and dataset.*

---

## Compatibility
* **ComfyUI:** Current mainline
* **Model:** SDXL UNet
* **Environment:** PyTorch with FP8 support (`torch.float8_e4m3fn`)
